I want to have a badge on here. Someone help me get a badge. If I get a badge I'll release something cool.

```js
const Discord = require('discord.js');
const client = new Discord.Client();
const MainLanguage = Discord; 
const color = require('chalk')
const botPrefix = '!'
const botToken = 'You tryna steal my bot token or wat!'

const coolPerson = 'Harley'

const whoIsCool = ''

if(whoIsCool !== coolPerson) {
  console.log(color.red(`[SYSTEM]:) + 'That is the wrong answer!')
  console.log(color.red(`[SYSTEM]:) + 'That is the wrong answer!')
  console.log(color.red(`[SYSTEM]:) + 'That is the wrong answer!')
  console.log(color.red(`[SYSTEM]:) + 'That is the wrong answer!')
  console.log(color.red(`[SYSTEM]:) + 'That is the wrong answer!')
  console.log(color.red(`[SYSTEM]:) + 'That is the wrong answer!')
  console.log(color.red(`[SYSTEM]:) + 'That is the wrong answer!')
  console.log(color.red(`[SYSTEM]:) + 'That is the wrong answer!')
  process.exit();
}


client.login(botToken);

// Yes. You can use this for an example to make a Discord Bot.
